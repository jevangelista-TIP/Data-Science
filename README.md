ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Joelâ€”a Computer Engineering student at the Technological University of the Philippines and a Control System Software Engineer for a utility company based in the Midwest. I thrive at the intersection of hardware and data, with a deep passion for embedded systems development using Raspberry Pi and modern Python-based data engineering and analysis.

My journey blends academic rigor with real-world application, allowing me to design intelligent systems that bridge physical infrastructure with digital insight. Whether I'm optimizing control algorithms or building IoT solutions for environmental monitoring, Iâ€™m driven by the challenge of turning raw data into meaningful action.
